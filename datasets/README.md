 For our research, we curated datasets with keywords related to transformers, sequential data, session-based data, and so on. We recorded them in the [Seq. datasets](Seq_datasets.xlsx) table. In total, we analyzed 130 papers from 3 top-tier conferences RecSys, SIGIR, and CIKM for the past 5
years (2019-2023) and found that 98 public datasets have been used in one or more of these papers. Next, we aggregated this information and created a ranking of datasets based on their frequency ([datasets_rank](datasets_rank.xlsx) table). Subsequently, we identified the most frequently used datasets and selected 12
datasets from different domains to use in our work. The sources of the datasets used in our research can be found in the [datasets info](Dataset_info.xlsx)  table for reference.
