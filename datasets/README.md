### For our research, we curated datasets with keywords related to transformers, sequential data, session-based data, and so on. We recorded them in the [Seq. datasets](Seq_datasets.xlsx) table. Next, we aggregated this information and created a ranking of datasets based on their frequency ([datasets_rank](datasets_rank.xlsx) table). Subsequently, we selected a subset of these datasets. The sources of the datasets can be found in the [datasets info](Dataset_info.xlsx)  table for reference.
